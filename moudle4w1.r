# Rules
# 1. Show comparisons
# 2. Show causalit, mechanism, explanation
# 3. Show multivariate data
# 4. Integrate multiple modes of evidence
# 5. Describe and document the evidence (source code)
# 6. Content is king

#quantile(vector) gets 0, 25, 50, 75, 100%
#boxplot(ppm, col="blue")
#abline(h=12) draws horizontal line at value 12. Simple quick "indicator" to prove a point on a plot
#hist(ppm, col = "green")
#rug(ppm): grayscale representation of histogram, shows concentration density
#hist(ppm, col = "green", breaks=100)
#abline(v=12, lwd=2) draws a vertical line,of thickness 2
